In addition to this stack, I've been doing some significant work with Serverless Architectures, building applications that are deployed to Amazon and Google NodeJS based serverless environments(Lambda/APIGateway and Google Cloud Functions).\n\nApart from software development, leading projects and building APIs, some of elements of interest in my contracting time have been implementing an OAuth based authentication gateway, and working on the Australian HL7 FHIR for  Provider Directory Services standard.\n\nIn my spare time I've had opportunity to give guest lectures at Griffith and QUT talking about Ruby/Ruby on Rails, and I present at various local user groups. For fun I've been reading up and listening to information about Merkle trees, and all things blockchain.

We've dedicated nearly a decade building proprietary, award-winning solutions that not only recognize and acknowledge how a person is feeling, but provide a better experience for them based on that knowledge. \n\nAs in real-life, you can't buy emotional intelligence. We operate our own flagship social media property, Experience Project, which connects over 15 million people a month on over 35M+ shared experiences. EP is renowned as a dramatic departure from traditional social media, providing meaningful connections at scale. 80% of our users say the site has changed their life for the better, and our marketing partners-- including Wal-Mart, GM, and Coke-- rely on us to tell the story of their brand as a product of experiences, thereby humanizing the company in a genuine way.\n\nFrom the unique attributes of EP, we have an enormous, proprietary, and continuously updated library of knowledge of how language, behavior, emotion and intent intersect. This yields a series of  algorithms, which can operate accurately anywhere people communicate to answer the question, \"How does this person feel, and what does what they are saying mean?\" \n\nWe have a point solution for each step of the customer journey, from brand messaging to retention, extending the vision of empathy in technology to the enterprise world. \n\nAs founder and CEO, I've done everything I can to enable our company to be successful, as I'm passionately obsessed with bringing our view of the world to mass market., Kanjoya and Twitter Co-Present the New Model of Employee Engagement, Kanjoya CEO Armen Berjikly and Twitter Director of People Analytics Shane McCauley took the stage at the HCI Summit in early April to present Twitter\u2019s new model of employee engagement, powered by the Kanjoya Perception\u2122 solution.

In a short span of 2.5 years, Syncplicity grew revenues by more than 30x for SaaS subscriptions and close to 100x for SaaS and storage drag combined. This was achieved through two key drivers - 1) Product differentiation based on the best mobility solution combined with hybrid storage deployment model; and 2) The force multiplication that comes from the large, direct EMC sales team.  \n\nI led a team that massively expanded the product footprint, both in terms of breadth and depth of features and use-cases.  Product strength and differentiation was built primarily around category-defining mobile apps (iOS, Android, Win Phone) and a secure hybrid cloud architecture (File & Object storage) that appealed to the world's largest enterprises.  As a result, Syncplicity was recognized by Gartner, Forrester, Aragon, and Ovum in 2014 and 2015 as a LEADER in the competitive and fast-paced enterprise file sync & share market (EFSS), including the rare feat of being named the leader in the very first Gartner Magic Quadrant for EFSS."
